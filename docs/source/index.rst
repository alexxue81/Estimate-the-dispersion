Welcome to the project page!
===================================

**scDispersion** is a statistical method to robustly estimate the dispersion parameter of the intra-individual gene expression across cells.

We will firstly use MLE method to esimate the dispersion of the intra-individual gene expression across all cells. Then, a Cox and Reid adjustment was added to the profile likelihood.

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
